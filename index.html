<!-- STEPS

  1) Went to site loading.io and chose a free loader design.  Played with it's colours/size etc.  Set it to transparent. Downloaded it as an animated SVG.  Placed it within the project folder.  

  2) Picked a Google font and used the @import method to bring it into CSS.  Added a H1 title to test font.  Changed bground colour to whitesmoke.  

  3) Added a loader class and img src="loader.svg" in index.html to display the loader. In CSS, added centering properties.

  4) Added a responsive layout for large smartphone viewing. Reduced title font-size and left-right margins.

  5) Created a new project application on Unsplash Developer and got an API key.  Created a fetch request.

  6) Create a Global variable called photosArray which is empty... will pass API data into this empty array. The displayPhotos() function will call on the photosArray variable and run a forEach method on it.  This will generate html elements based on the data requested from the API (photo link, photo size, photo alt description and photo title)
